Supply Chain Management (SCM) is the backbone of transforming raw materials into final products and ensuring efficient delivery to customers. It encompasses key stages like planning, sourcing, manufacturing, distribution, and returns. SCM optimizes cost, quality, and speed, driving profitability and customer satisfaction. With the rise of logistics, resource management, and information flow, SCM becomes vital for businesses aiming for efficiency and competitive advantage. Companies like Walgreens are leveraging technology and big data to enhance forecasting and streamline operations. Effective SCM can lead to cost savings, improved product quality, and stronger customer loyalty.
